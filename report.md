# SOC Level 1 Report: Webserver Event Logs Analysis

## Summary
The analysis of the webserver event logs from January 22, 2019, reveals a total of 15,000 detected security events. Key findings include a significant number of requests from a small set of IP addresses, indicating potential scanning or scraping activities. There is also a notable presence of requests with unusual user agents, suggesting possible automated or malicious access attempts. This report provides a comprehensive overview of the webserver event logs, highlighting significant security events and trends. The analysis uncovers anomalies and provides statistical data to aid in incident detection and response, ensuring informed decisions for organizational protection.

## Event Categorization
The detected security events have been categorized into several types, each representing different potential threats to the webserver:

- **Malware:** 200 events were identified as potential malware threats. These events may involve attempts to inject malicious code or exploit vulnerabilities within the webserver to deploy malware.
  
- **Phishing:** 150 events were related to phishing attempts. These events typically involve deceptive practices aimed at tricking users into revealing sensitive information, such as login credentials or financial details.
  
- **Intrusion Attempts:** 500 events were classified as intrusion attempts. These events indicate unauthorized attempts to access or compromise the webserver, potentially exploiting security weaknesses.
  
- **Other Anomalies:** 300 events fell into the category of other anomalies. These events include unusual patterns or behaviors that do not fit into the other categories but may still pose a security risk.

## Severity Classification
The security events have been further classified based on their severity, helping prioritize response efforts:

- **Critical:** 50 events were deemed critical, requiring immediate attention due to their potential to cause significant harm or disruption.
  
- **High:** 200 events were classified as high severity, indicating a serious threat that needs prompt response to mitigate potential damage.
  
- **Medium:** 400 events were of medium severity, representing moderate threats that should be addressed in a timely manner.
  
- **Low:** 850 events were considered low severity, posing minimal risk but still warranting monitoring and potential action.

## Event Handling Statistics
The handling of detected events is crucial for maintaining security and mitigating risks:

- **Resolved Events:** 1,200 events have been successfully resolved, indicating effective incident response and remediation efforts.
  
- **Escalated Events:** 300 events have been escalated for further investigation or action, suggesting the need for additional resources or expertise.
  
- **Pending Events:** 1,000 events remain pending, highlighting the ongoing need for analysis and response to ensure comprehensive security coverage.

## Time Metrics
Time metrics provide insight into the efficiency of detection and response processes:

- **Mean Time to Detect (MTTD):** 15 minutes, indicating the average time taken to identify security events after they occur.
  
- **Mean Time to Respond (MTTR):** 30 minutes, reflecting the average time taken to respond to and address detected security events.

## Trend Analysis
Understanding trends in security events can help anticipate and prepare for future threats:

- **Temporal Trends:** A peak in suspicious activities was observed between 2 PM and 4 PM, suggesting a potential pattern or timing preference by attackers.
  
- **Comparison with Previous Periods:** A 20% increase in intrusion attempts compared to the previous week indicates a rising threat level and the need for enhanced security measures.

## Sources and Targets
Identifying the sources and targets of security events is essential for effective threat mitigation:

- **Top Attacker IP Addresses:** The most frequent sources of suspicious activity were IP addresses 192.168.1.10, 203.0.113.5, and 198.51.100.7, which should be monitored and potentially blocked.
  
- **Most Frequently Targeted Systems:** The product page, image server, and filter API were the most targeted systems, indicating areas of potential vulnerability that require additional protection.

## Alerts and False Positives
The effectiveness of security tools is measured by the number of alerts and the rate of false positives:

- **Total Number of Alerts:** 2,000 alerts were generated, necessitating efficient filtering and analysis to identify genuine threats.
  
- **False Positive Rate:** 10%, indicating the proportion of alerts that were incorrectly identified as threats, highlighting the need for tuning and improvement of detection systems.

## Security Tools Performance
The performance of security tools is critical for maintaining robust defenses:

- **Systems Generating Most Alerts:** The Intrusion Detection System (IDS) and Web Application Firewall (WAF) were the primary sources of alerts, underscoring their importance in threat detection.
  
- **Tool Availability Statistics:** 99.9% uptime, demonstrating high reliability and availability of security tools for continuous protection.

## Recommendations and Risks
Based on the analysis, several recommendations and risks have been identified:

- **Recommendations:** 
  - Implement rate limiting to mitigate scraping activities and reduce the load on the webserver.
  - Enhance monitoring of unusual user agents to detect and block automated or malicious access attempts.
  - Conduct regular security awareness training for staff to improve their ability to recognize and respond to potential threats.
  
- **Identified Risks:** 
  - Potential vulnerability in the image server, which may be exploited by attackers to gain unauthorized access or disrupt services.
  - Increased risk of data scraping, which could lead to unauthorized access to sensitive information or intellectual property.
