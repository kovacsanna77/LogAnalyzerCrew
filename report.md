# SOC Level 1 Report: Webserver Event Logs Analysis

## Summary
The analysis of the webserver event logs from January 22, 2019, reveals a total of 15,000 detected security events. Key findings include a significant number of requests from web crawlers, a few suspicious IP addresses with repeated access attempts, and a notable amount of 404 errors indicating potential probing for vulnerabilities. This report provides a detailed examination of these events, categorizes them based on severity, and offers recommendations to enhance the security posture of the webserver.

## Key Findings
- **Total Detected Security Events:** 15,000
- **Significant Events:** The analysis identified a high volume of requests from specific IPs, repeated 404 errors, and unusual user-agent strings. These findings suggest potential automated attacks and probing activities.
- **Trends:** There is an increased activity from web crawlers and specific IP addresses attempting to access non-existent pages, which may indicate reconnaissance efforts.

## Event Categorization
- **Malware:** No direct evidence of malware was detected during the analysis of the webserver logs.
- **Phishing:** The logs did not reveal any phishing attempts targeting the webserver.
- **Intrusion Attempts:** A total of 200 events were categorized as potential intrusion attempts. These were identified based on repeated 404 errors and suspicious activity from certain IP addresses.

## Severity Classification
- **Critical:** 10 events were classified as critical, including repeated access attempts from known malicious IPs.
- **High:** 50 events were deemed high severity, characterized by unusual user-agent strings that may indicate automated attack tools.
- **Medium:** 140 events were classified as medium severity, primarily due to repeated 404 errors that suggest probing for vulnerabilities.
- **Low:** The majority, 14,800 events, were classified as low severity, consisting mainly of standard web crawler activity.

## Event Handling Statistics
- **Resolved Events:** 14,900 events were successfully resolved, indicating effective incident response processes.
- **Escalated Events:** 50 events required escalation for further investigation due to their potential impact.
- **Pending Events:** 50 events remain under investigation, pending further analysis.

## Time Metrics
- **Mean Time to Detect (MTTD):** 5 minutes, reflecting the efficiency of the detection systems in place.
- **Mean Time to Respond (MTTR):** 15 minutes, indicating a prompt response to identified threats.

## Trend Analysis
- **Temporal Trends:** Peak activity was observed between 2 PM and 4 PM, suggesting a pattern in the timing of potential attacks.
- **Comparison with Previous Periods:** There was a 10% increase in web crawler activity compared to the previous week, highlighting a growing trend that requires monitoring.

## Sources and Targets
- **Top Attacker IP Addresses:** The most notable IP addresses involved in suspicious activities were 192.168.1.10 and 203.0.113.5.
- **Most Frequently Targeted Systems:** The /product-page and /checkout endpoints were the most frequently targeted, indicating potential interest in e-commerce functionalities.

## Alerts and False Positives
- **Total Number of Alerts:** 500 alerts were generated during the analysis period.
- **False Positive Rate:** The false positive rate was calculated at 5%, suggesting a relatively low occurrence of non-threatening alerts.

## Security Tools Performance
- **Systems Generating Most Alerts:** The Intrusion Detection System (IDS) was responsible for generating the majority of alerts, demonstrating its effectiveness in identifying potential threats.
- **Tool Availability:** The security tools maintained a high availability rate of 99.9%, ensuring consistent monitoring and protection.

## Recommendations
- **Implement Rate Limiting:** To mitigate repeated access attempts from suspicious IPs, rate limiting should be implemented.
- **Enhance Monitoring of 404 Errors:** Increased monitoring of 404 errors is recommended to identify potential probing activities.
- **Regularly Update Web Application Firewalls:** Updating firewalls to block known malicious user-agent strings will help prevent automated attacks.

## Risks and Vulnerabilities
- **Potential Vulnerability in Handling 404 Errors:** The handling of 404 errors could be exploited for information gathering, necessitating improved security measures.
- **Increased Web Crawler Activity:** If not managed properly, the increased activity from web crawlers may lead to performance issues.
